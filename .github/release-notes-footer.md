## Installation

1. Download **HueBar.zip** from the Assets section below
2. Unzip and move **HueBar.app** to `/Applications`
3. On first launch, **right-click → Open** (the app is ad-hoc signed, so Gatekeeper will ask for confirmation once)
4. Connect to your Hue Bridge when prompted

**Requirements:** macOS 15.0 (Sequoia) or later
